# Computer Graphics: Scene processing and texturing ðŸ›¸ ðŸŒŒ

Linear algebra has wide application in the field of engineering and computer science. Here is described the graphic process of texturing objects. You will need: 

[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and GLUT Utility Toolkit

The idea is to apply the texture and altimetry of the planet Mars ðŸŸ¤ (available at \ textit {http://planetpixelemporium.com/mars.html}) in a sphere. For this, knowledge of linear algebra is needed, specifically transformations and geometry.
