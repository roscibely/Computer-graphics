# Computer Graphics: Scene processing and texturing ðŸ›¸ ðŸŒŒ

Linear algebra has wide application in the field of engineering and computer science. Here is described the graphic process of texturing objects. You will need: 

[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and GLUT Utility Toolkit

The idea is to apply the texture and altimetry of the planet Mars ðŸŸ¤ (available at [here](http://planetpixelemporium.com/mars.html) ) in a sphere. For this, knowledge of linear algebra is needed, specifically transformations and geometry.

    II. Altimetry

    III. Modeling
    
    The sphere radius can be written as a function of the circle radius formed by a section $ R $, and the distance between the plane of the section and the center of the sphere $ R-h $,
    $$r = \sqrt{R^2 - (R- h)^2}.$$
